# Retrokid

### No longer maintaned.

Written in Swift and SpriteKit3.
This game was just a prototype to learn spritekit 3 library.

You can do whatever you want with the code.

But about the assets.
Tile map assets were from www.kenney.nl.
It was free of use when i downloaded them, but you should check their license.
I don't remember where was other assets so i don't know their license.

Keyboard Controls
MOVEMENT : W,A,S,D buttons
