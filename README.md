# Retrokid

### No longer maintaned.

Written in Swift and SpriteKit3.
This game was just a prototype to learn spritekit 3 library.

But about the assets.

Tile map assets were from www.kenney.nl.
It was free of use when i downloaded them, but you should check their license.

I don't remember where did i download other assets so i don't know their license.
